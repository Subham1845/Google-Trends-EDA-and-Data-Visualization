### Introduction

Google Trends gives us an estimate of search volume. Let's explore if search popularity relates to other kinds of data. Perhaps there are patterns in Google's search volume and the price of Bitcoin or a hot stock like Tesla. Perhaps search volume for the term "Unemployment Benefits" can tell us something about the actual unemployment rate?
